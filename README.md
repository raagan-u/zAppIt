zAppIt is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that enables seamless **cross-chain payments and fund requests** through the simplicity of **NFC taps**. Beyond payments, zAppIt unlocks **anonymous user networking** powered by **zero-knowledge proofs**, paving the way for decentralized marketplaces, auctions, and privacy-preserving social interactions.

## ✨ Features

* **NFC-powered transfers** – tap to send or request funds.
* **Cross-chain swaps & bridging** – instant transfers across networks.
* **Microtransaction support** – low-cost, fast transactions.
* **ZK-proof anonymity** – interact privately without revealing identity.
* **Anonymous posting and voting** – share content and vote without revealing identity.
* **Private circles with secret-based membership** – control access to content securely.
* **Encrypted content storage** – all shared data is stored securely and privately.
* **On-chain proof verification** – verify actions without exposing sensitive info.
* **Support for any file type** – text, images, audio, and more.
* **Future-ready** – upcoming support for *bridged NFC transfers* across different chains.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **React Native** – cross-platform mobile application.
* **Garden APIs** – for instant cross-chain bridging.
* **Polygon** – powering fast, cost-efficient swaps and transfers.
* **Noir (ZK circuits)** – enabling privacy-preserving networking.

## 🚀 Future Plans

* Integrate bridging directly into NFC transfers (users on different chains can transact seamlessly).
* Expand beyond mobile to all **NFC-enabled devices** such as smartwatches and wristbands.
* Enable advanced DeFi use cases like decentralized auctions and marketplaces.
